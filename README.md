# Qualcomm速 Innovators Development Kit - QIDK

Qualcomm速 Innovators Development Kit (QIDK) provides sample applications to demonstrate the capability of Hardware Accelerators for AI, and Software AI stack.

This repository contains sample android applications, which are designed to use components from the following products:

1. [Qualcomm速 Neural Processing SDK for AI](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-63442-2/introduction.html?product=1601111740010412)
   Also referred to as SNPE
2. [Qualcomm速 AI Engine Direct SDK](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-63442-50/introduction.html?product=1601111740009302)
   Also referred to as QNN
3. [AI Model Efficiency Tool Kit (AIMET)](https://github.com/quic/aimet)
4. [AIMET Model Zoo](https://github.com/quic/aimet-model-zoo)
5. [Android Studio]: (Download link: https://developer.android.com/studio/archive)
   The recommended version of Android Studio for compiling QIDK Android application is Android Studio Dolphin Version 2021.3.1 Beta 1

Contents of this repository are verified on Snapdragon 8 Gen2, and Snapdragon 8 Gen3 platforms. 
If users want to try this content on other Qualcomm platforms - please do check with the support e-mail mentioned below. 

This Repository is divided into following categories

## QWA Course - AI on Qualcomm Innovators Development Kit 

Qualcomm Wireless Academy has a free course on "AI on Qualcomm Innovators Development Kit".<br><br>
Course Link : https://qwa.qualcomm.com/course-catalog/AI-on-QIDK

This course is geared toward AI application developers, university students, and AI enthusiasts.
This course is applicable, even if a developer is AI SDK on Qualcomm platforms other than QIDK. 

All QIDK deliverables are covered in this course in detail with hands-on lab sessions. 

### Download AI SDK 

Please note the change in steps to download AI SDK (Steps in QWA course will be modified later)
Users need to follow below procedure do download AI SDK. 
1. Download sdk from this link https://softwarecenter.qualcomm.com/api/download/software/sdks/Qualcomm_AI_Runtime_Community/All/2.35.0.250530/v2.35.0.250530.zip

Or

1. Visit qpm.qualcomm.com
2. Download AI SDK for Linux (Linux is the host platform for development, QIDK has Android as target platform)
