To enhance that, HRNET uses object-detect model to identify a single person in a frame and then give the data to HRNET to get pose of that person. In this solution, we use MobileNetSSD for detecting human and then give the preprocesssed data to HRNET to achieve better accuracy for pose estimation.\n",
